1. LICENSE AGREEMENT.

2. The article "Parameterized Expectations Algorithm: How to Solve for 
   Labor Easily" by Lilia Maliar and Serguei Maliar, (2005), Computational

3. MATLAB FILES.

   a. "Main1.m" computes hours worked at each date;    
   b. "Main2.m" approximates labor function on a grid and computes hours 
       worked by interpolation of the constructed function; 
   c. "Main3.m" parameterizes the expectations in terms of the labor 
       function;
   d. "object.m" is objective function for the PEAs;
   e. "labor.m" is the labor function on the grid; 
   f. "shocks.m" is a separate program that creates series for shocks; 
   g. "csolve.m" (a solver written by Christopher Sims).
